## Hello, my name is Bonnie Cooper, PhD.
### I'm a Visual Neuroscientist with one eye on Data Science and the other on UX Research

Currently a post-doctoral research fellow investigating perceptual decision making and the allocation of attention with an accute desire to apply this skillset to UX Research.  

I have 10+ years of experience investigating the neural mechanisms that enable us to visually perceive the world around us and am in constant awe of how our brains acheive this. My research experience ranges from very low-level visual function in studies of contrast responses of cells in the retina to higher-level studies of cognitive functions such as how we allocate attention to visual targets in our environment. This experience will lend to unique and nuanced insights for understanding how users interact with new technologies.  

Outside of research science, I am passionate about training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, homebrewing beer, reading sci-fi and cheering on the New York Rangers
